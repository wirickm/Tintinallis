Control of the airway is the single most important task for emergency resuscitation.

**INITIAL APPROACH**
The initial approach to airway management is simultaneous assessment and management of the adequacy of airway patency (the A of the ABCs) and oxygenation and ventilation (the B of the ABCs). 

1. Assess patient’s color and respiratory rate; respiratory or cardiac arrest may be an indication for immediate intubation.  
2. Open the airway with head tilt–chin lift maneuver (use jaw thrust if C-spine injury is suspected). If needed, bag the patient with the bag-valve-mask device that includes an O2 reservoir. A good seal depends on proper mask size. This technique may require an oral or nasal airway or two rescuers (one to seal the mask with 2 hands and the other to bag the patient). 
3. Provide continuous monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and end-tidal CO2 (if possible).  
4. Determine the need for invasive airway management techniques. Do not wait for arterial blood gas analyses if the initial assessment indicates the need for invasive airway management. If the patient does not require immediate airway or ventilation control, administer oxygen by facemask to ensure an O2 saturation of 95%. Do not remove oxygen to draw an arterial blood gas analysis unless deemed safe from the initial assessment.  
5. Preoxygenate all patients prior to intubation regardless of saturation. Assess airway difficulty before initiation of advanced airway techniques.    

**OROTRACHEAL INTUBATION**
The most common means used to ensure a patent airway, prevent aspiration, and provide oxygenation and ventilation is orotracheal intubation. Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) should be used unless the patient’s condition makes it unnecessary (i.e., cardiac arrest) or it is contraindicated because of an anticipated difficult airway.

1. Prepare equipment, personnel, and drugs before attempting intubation. Assess airway difficulty and anticipate required airway rescue. Assemble and place suction, bag-valve-mask and rescue devices within easy reach. Personnel should be present at the bedside to pass equipment or bag the patient, if required.  
2. Ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation and monitoring while preparing equipment. Preoxygenate with a non–rebreather oxygen mask at maximal oxygen flow rates or with a bag-valve-mask if the patient is not ventilating adequately.  
3. Select blade type and size (usually a No. 3 or 4 curved blade or a No. 2 or 3 straight blade); test the blade light. Select the tube size (usually 7.5 to 8.0 mm in women, 8.0 to 8.5 mm in men) and test the balloon cuff. The use of a flexible stylet is recommended.  
4. Position the patient with the head extended and neck flexed, possibly with a rolled towel under the occiput. If C-spine injury is suspected, maintain the head and neck in a neutral position with an assistant performing inline stabilization. 
5. With the handle in the operator’s left hand, insert the blade to push the tongue to the patient’s left and slowly advance to the epiglottis. Suctioning may be required. It is not uncommon to go past the larynx into the esophagus. Gradually withdraw the blade to reveal the epiglottis. If the curved blade is used, slide the tip into the vallecula and lift (indirectly lifting the epiglottis); if a straight blade is used, lift the epiglottis directly. Lift along the axis of the laryngoscope handle. Avoid levering the blade on the teeth to prevent dental trauma.  
6. Once the vocal cords are visualized, gently pass the tube between the cords. Remove the tube, check for tube placement by ventilating and listening for bilateral breath sounds and absence of epigastric sounds. Inflate the cuff.
7. If the cords are not visualized, manipulate the thyroid cartilage using backward, upward, and rightward pressure (the “burp” maneuver) to help bring the cords into view. If unsuccessful, reoxygenation may need to be performed with bag-valve-mask device. Consider changing the blade, the tube size, or the position of the patient before further attempts. Consider using an intubating stylet (bougie). Three unsuccessful attempts define a failed airway, and other rescue techniques must be considered. 
8. Confirm placement objectively with an end-tidal CO2 detector, capnography, or in cardiac arrest, an esophageal detection device. Check tube length; the usual distance (marked on the tube) from corner of the mouth to 2 cm above the carina is 23 cm in men and 21 cm in women.  
9. Secure the tube and verify placement with a portable radiograph.   

Immediate complications include unrecognized esophageal intubation or mainstem bronchus intubation.

Endobronchial intubation is usually on the right side and is corrected by withdrawing the tube 2 cm and listening for equal breath sounds. 

Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) is the simultaneous administration of an induction and a neuromuscular blocking agent to facilitate orotracheal intubation. This technique couples sedation with muscular paralysis. Anticipated difficulty in mask ventilation or intubation is a relative contraindication to RSI. The presence of 2 of the following 5 factors predict possible difficulty with bagging: facial hair, obesity, no teeth, advanced age, or snoring. Multiple external features, such as facial hair, obesity, short neck, short or long chin, and any airway deformity, suggest possible difficulty with intubation. A small oral opening, decreased neck mobility, and a poor view of the posterior pharynx also suggest possible problems. If difficulty is anticipated, consider other methods of airway management such as videolaryngoscopy, awake intubation, cricothyrotomy, or an alternative airway device. 

1. Prepare equipment, medication, and personnel before initiation of RSI. Check equipment function.  
2. Preoxygenate the patient with 100% oxygen. 
3. Consider pretreatment in patients with reactive airway disease or increased intracranial pressure. Evidence is mixed on whether pretreatment improves outcomes. Fentanyl, 3 micrograms/kilogram may be used in normotensive patients with possible raised intracranial pressure, cardiac ischemia, or aortic dissection. Lidocaine, 1 milligram/kilogram IV, could be used in patients with possible raised ICP or asthma. 
4. An induction agent should be pushed intravenously. Etomidate, 0.3 milligrams/kilogram, is an excellent choice in most circumstances. Propofol, 0.5 to 1.5 milligrams/kilogram or ketamine 1 to 2 milligrams/kilogram may also be considered. Use caution in hypotensive patients; avoid propofol. Ketamine is a good choice for patients with active bronchospasm and may be the best choice in hypotensive patients.  
5. Push a paralytic agent intravenously immediately after the induction dose. Succinylcholine, 1.0 to 1.5 milligrams/kilogram, is preferred in most cases because of its rapid onset and short duration of action; it should not be used in a patient with a neuromuscular disorder, a denervation injury older than 7 days, or severe burns older than 5 days because hyperkalemia may occur. Rocuronium, 1 milligram/kilogram IV, a non-depolarizing agent, is a reasonable alternative.  
6. Cricoid pressure may be applied at the discretion of the provider; however, it can be associated with a worsening laryngoscopic view and ability to bag-ventilate. 
7. Once muscle relaxation occurs, usually after 35 to 60 seconds, intubate the trachea and confirm tube placement using the techniques described above.  
8. Be prepared to use bag-mask ventilation if intubation fails and saturations are less than 90%. Three unsuccessful attempts define a failed airway, and other rescue techniques must be considered.    

Alternative airway devices include intubating stylets (or gum elastic bougies) which are semi-rigid stylets with a coude tip, placed by feel during laryngoscopy into the trachea. The tracheal tube is then guided over the intubating stylet into the trachea. The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is an airway device placed blindly into the supraglottic space. A distal ringed balloon is inflated which seals the glottis above the larynx and allows for ventilation. A disadvantage is that the airway is not protected from aspiration and leaks may occur at high ventilatory pressures. The Intubating-LMA allows for the placement of a cuffed endotracheal tube through the device. 

Videolaryngoscopy is an excellent option for airway rescue or as a primary intubation technique, demonstrating improved laryngoscopic views compared to traditional laryngoscopy. These devices can be advantageous in patients with restricted oral opening or cervical spine mobility. 

Cricothyrotomy is performed when intubation, ventilation, and airway rescue have failed.

ricothyrotomy is contraindicated in children younger than 10 to 12 years in whom trans tracheal jet ventilation is the preferred subglottic technique. 

1. Use sterile technique. Palpate the cricothyroid membrane and stabilize the larynx. With a No. 11 scalpel, make a vertical, 3 to 4 cm incision starting at the superior border of the thyroid cartilage. Incise caudally toward the suprasternal notch.  
   
2. Repalpate the membrane and make a 1 to 2 cm horizontal incision through the cricothyroid membrane. Keep the blade in place temporarily.  

3. Stabilize the trachea by inserting the tracheal hook into the cricothyroid space and retracting the inferior edge of the thyroid cartilage (an assistant should hold the hook after it is placed).  

4. Remove the scalpel and insert a dilator to enlarge the opening (LaBorde or Trousseau).

5. Introduce a No. 4 cuffed tracheostomy tube (or the largest tube that will fit). Alternatively, use a small cuffed endotracheal tube (No. 6 or the largest tube that will fit). Inflate the cuff.  

6. Check for bilateral breath sounds. After confirmation of tube placement, remove the hook. Secure the tube. The presence of subcutaneous air suggests placement outside the trachea. Placement should be confirmed with an end-tidal CO2 detector and radiograph.   

Manufactured cricothyrotomy kits using a Seldinger technique are also available. Formal tracheostomy is not recommended as an emergency surgical airway technique due to increased technical difficulty and increased time required. 

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) provides positive pressure airway support using preset volume/pressure of inspiratory air through a face or nasal mask. NPPV has been used as an alternative to endotracheal intubation in patients with ventilatory failure due to COPD and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Patients need to be cooperative and without cardiac ischemia, hypotension, or dysrhythmia. 

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) provides constant positive pressure throughout the respiratory cycle. CPAP pressures are usually between 5 and 15 cm H2O and are adjusted to the patients’ response to therapy. 

Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) uses different levels of pressure during inspiration and expiration. Initial settings of 8 to 10 cm H2O during inspiration and 3 to 4 cm H2O during expiration are reasonable and can be titrated up based on clinical response. 

Alternative drugs for rapid sequence induction are listed in Chapter 30 of Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide, 7th ed. Airway management alternatives to the methods described earlier include blind nasotracheal intubation, digital intubation, transillumination, extraglottic devices, flexible and rigid fiberoptics, retrograde tracheal intubation, and translaryngeal ventilation.

Michael Roman; Chapter 30, “Tracheal Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation,” by Robert J. Vissers and Daniel F. Danzl; and Chapter 31, “Surgical Airway Management,” by Michael D. Smith. 

Sinus arrhythmia is present if the variation exceeds 0.12 second between the longest and shortest intervals. The electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics of sinus arrhythmia are normal sinus P waves and PR intervals, 1:1 atrioventricular (AV) conduction, and variation of at least 0.12 second between the shortest and longest P–P interval. Sinus arrhythmias are affected primarily by respiration and are most commonly found in children and young adults, disappearing with advancing age. Occasional junctional escape beats may be present during very long P–P intervals. No treatment is required. 

Premature atrial contractions (PACs) have the following ECG characteristics: the ectopic P wave appears sooner (premature) than the next expected sinus beat; the ectopic P wave has a different shape and direction; and the ectopic P wave may or may not be conducted through the AV node. Most PACs are conducted with typical QRS complexes.

some may be conducted aberrantly through the infranodal system, typically with a right bundle branch block pattern. When the PAC occurs during the absolute refractory period, it is not conducted. Since the sinus node is often depolarized and reset, the pause is less than fully compensatory. PACs are associated with stress, fatigue, alcohol use, tobacco, coffee, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), digoxin toxicity, coronary artery disease, and may occur after adenosine-converted paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). PACs are common in all ages, often in the absence of significant heart disease. Patients may complain of palpitations or an intermittent “sinking” or “fluttering” feeling in the chest.

Emergency Department Care and Disposition  
1. Discontinue precipitating drugs (alcohol, tobacco, or coffee) or toxins.  
2. Treat underlying disorders (stress or fatigue).  
3. PACs that produce significant symptoms or initiate sustained tachycardias can be suppressed with agents such as β-adrenergic antagonists (eg, metoprolol 25 to 50 milligrams PO 3 times daily), usually in consultation with a follow-up physician.  

Sinus Bradycardia  
Clinical Features  
Sinus bradycardia occurs when the SA node rate becomes slower than 60 beats/min. The ECG characteristics of sinus bradycardia are (a) normal sinus P waves and PR intervals, (b) 1:1 AV conduction, and (c) atrial rate slower than 60 beats/min. Sinus bradycardia represents a suppression of the sinus node discharge rate, usually in response to 3 categories of stimuli: (a) physiologic (vagal tone), (b) pharmacologic (calcium channel blockers, β-blockers, or digoxin), and (c) pathologic (acute inferior myocardial infarction [MI], increased intracranial pressure, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, hypothyroidism, or sick sinus syndrome).  

Emergency Department Care and Disposition  
Sinus bradycardia usually does not require specific treatment unless the heart rate is slower than 50 beats/min and there is evidence of hypoperfusion.  
1. Transcutaneous cardiac pacing is the only Class I treatment for unstable patients.  
   a. Attach the patient to the monitor leads of the external pacing device.  
   b. When placing transcutaneous pacing pads, place the anterior pad over the left lateral precordium and the posterior pad at the level of the heart in the right infrascapular area. Do not use multifunction pacing defibrillation pads unless the patient is unconscious as they cause a lot of discomfort.  
   c. Slowly increase the pacing output from 0 mA to the lowest point where capture is observed, usually at 50 to 100 mA, but may be up to 200 mA. A widened QRS after each pacing spike denotes electrical capture.  
   d. If needed, administer a sedative, such as lorazepam, 1 to 2 milligrams IV, or an opiate, such as morphine, 2 to 4 milligrams IV, for pain control.  
2. Atropine is a Class IIa treatment for symptomatic bradycardia. The dose is 0.5 milligram IV push, repeated every 3 to 5 min as needed up to a total of 3 milligrams IV. If given via endotracheal tube, increase the dose by 2 to 2.5 times over the IV dose. Slow administration or lower doses may cause paradoxical bradycardia. Atropine may not be effective in cardiac transplant patients since the heart is denervated and has no vagal stimulation.  
3. Epinephrine, 2 to 10 micrograms/min IV, or dopamine, 3 to 10 micrograms/kilogram/min IV, may be used if external pacing is not available.  
4. Internal pacing will be required in the patient with symptomatic recurrent or persistent sinus bradycardia due to sick sinus syndrome.  
5. Isoproterenol, 2 to 10 micrograms/min IV infusion may be effective but carries a risk of increased myocardial oxygen demand and hypotension.  

Sinus Tachycardia  
Clinical Features  
The ECG characteristics of sinus tachycardia are (a) normal sinus P waves and PR intervals and (b) an atrial rate usually between 100 and 160 beats/min. Sinus tachycardia is in response to three categories of stimuli: (a) physiologic (pain or exertion), (b) pharmacologic (sympathomimetics, caffeine, or bronchodilators), or (c) pathologic (fever, hypoxia, anemia, hypovolemia, pulmonary embolism, or hyperthyroidism). In many of these conditions, the increased heart rate is an effort to increase cardiac output to match increased circulatory needs.  

Emergency Department Care and Disposition  
Diagnose and treat the underlying condition.  
Supraventricular Tachycardia  
Clinical Features  
Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a regular, rapid rhythm.

hm that arises from impulse reentry or an ectopic pacemaker above the bifurcation of the His bundle. The reentrant variety is the most common. Patients often present with acute, symptomatic episodes termed paroxysmal supra-ventricular tachycardia (PSVT). Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (A VnRT) can occur in a normal heart or in association with rheumatic heart disease, acute pericarditis, MI, mitral valve prolapse, or preexcitation syndromes. In patients with atrioventricular bypass tracts (A VRT), reentry can occur in either direction, usually (80 to 90% of patients) in a direction that goes down the A V node and up the bypass tract producing a narrow QRS complex (orthodromic conduction). In the remaining 10% to 20% of patients, reentry occurs in the reverse direction (antidromic conduction). Ectopic SVT usually originates in the atria, with an atrial rate of 100 to 250 beats/min and may be seen in patients with acute MI, chronic lung disease, pneumonia, alcohol intoxication, or digoxin toxicity.

There is a high incidence of tachyarrhythmias in patients with preexcitation syndromes including PSVT (40–80%), atrial fibrillation (10–20%), and atrial flutter (about 5%). All forms of preexcitation are caused by accessory tracts that bypass part or all of the normal conducting system, the most common form being Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The ventricles are activated by an impulse from the atria sooner than would be expected if the impulse were transmitted down the normal conducting pathway. This premature activation causes initial fusion beat morphology with slurring of initial QRS complex, causing the pathognomonic delta wave. Among patients with WPW-PSVT, 80% to 90% will conduct in the orthodromic direction and the remaining 10% to 20% will conduct in the antidromic direction. ECG findings of atrial fibrillation or flutter with antidromic conduction down the bypass tract show a wide QRS complex that is irregular with a rate faster than 180 to 200 beats/min.

Emergency Department Care and Disposition:
1. Perform synchronized cardioversion in any unstable patient (e.g., hypotension, pulmonary edema, or severe chest pain).
2. In stable patients, the first intervention should be vagal maneuvers, including:
   a. Valsalva maneuver: While in the supine position, ask the patient to strain for at least 10 seconds. The legs may be lifted to increase venous return and augment the reflex.
   b. Diving reflex: Have the patient immerse the face in cold water or apply a bag of ice water to the face for 6 to 7 seconds. This maneuver is particularly effective in infants.
   c. Carotid sinus massage: Auscultate to ensure that there is no carotid bruit and massage the carotid sinus against the transverse process of C6 for 10 seconds at a time, first on the side of the nondominant cerebral hemisphere. This should never be done simultaneously on both sides.
3. Administer adenosine, 6 milligrams rapid IV bolus, into a large vein followed by a 20 mL normal saline rapid flush. If there is no effect within 2 min, give a second dose of 12 milligrams IV. Most patients experience distressing chest pain, flushing, or anxiety lasting less than 1 min. Ten percent of patients may experience transient atrial fibrillation or flutter after conversion. This is first-line treatment for WPW-associated SVT with a narrow QRS complex (orthodromic conduction) but is ineffective in cases of anterograde conduction over an accessory pathway. Adenosine may induce bronchospasm in asthmatics requiring treatment with bronchodilators.
4. In patients with narrow-complex SVT (orthodromic conduction) and normal cardiac function, cardioversion may also be achieved with the following second-line agents:
   a. Calcium-channel blockers. Diltiazem, 20 milligrams (0.25 milligram/kilogram) IV over 2 min, or verapamil, 0.075 to 0.15 milligram/kilogram (3 to 10 milligrams) IV over 15 to 60 seconds with a repeat dose in 30 min, if necessary. Verapamil may cause hypotension that can be prevented by pretreatment with calcium chloride or gluconate (500 to 1000 milligrams).
   b. Beta-blockers. Esmolol, 500 micrograms/kilogram IV bolus, metoprolol, 5 milligrams IV, or propranolol, 0.1 milligram/kilogram divided in three doses given 2 min apart.
   c. Digoxin, 0.4 to 0.6 milligrams IV.
5. Patients with wide-complex SVT (antidromic conduction across accessory pathway) should be approached as presumed ventricular tachycardia (VT) unless there is a known history of WPW.

Patients with tachycardia are at risk for rapid ventricular rates and degeneration into VF; therefore, agents that preferentially block the AV node such as β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin should not be used. Treat stable patients with procainamide, 17 milligrams/kilogram IV over 30 min up to 50 milligrams/kilogram, or until 50% QRS widening is noted (contraindicated in patients with myasthenia gravis since it may increase weakness).

Atrial flutter originates from a small area within the atria. ECG characteristics include a regular atrial rate between 250 and 350 beats/min, “saw tooth” flutter waves directed superiorly, and AV block, usually 2:1. Carotid sinus massage or Valsalva maneuvers can slow the ventricular response by increasing AV block, which can unmask flutter waves. Atrial flutter is commonly seen in patients with ischemic heart disease, CHF, acute MI, pulmonary embolus, myocarditis, blunt chest trauma, and digoxin toxicity. Consider anticoagulation in patients with an unclear time of onset or duration longer than 48 hours before conversion to sinus rhythm due to increased risk of atrial thrombus and embolization.

Atrial fibrillation (Afib) occurs when multiple small areas of atrial myocardium continuously discharge in a disorganized fashion, resulting in loss of effective atrial contraction and decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume. ECG characteristics include fibrillatory waves of atrial activity and an irregular ventricular response, usually between 170 to 180 beats/min. Afib can be paroxysmal, persistent, or chronic, and may be associated with longstanding hypertension, ischemic heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, alcohol use, COPD, and thyrotoxicosis. Patients with LV dysfunction may suffer acute CHF with Afib onset. Rates greater than 300 beats/min with a wide QRS complex are concerning for a preexcitation syndrome such as WPW. Patients with Afib who are not anticoagulated have a yearly embolic event rate as high as 5% and a lifetime risk greater than 25%. Conversion from chronic Afib to sinus rhythm carries a 1% to 5% risk of arterial embolism; therefore, anticoagulation for 3 weeks is required before cardioversion in patients with Afib for longer than 48 hours duration and in those with an uncertain time of onset who are not on anticoagulation therapy.

Emergency Department Care and Disposition:
1. Treat unstable patients with synchronized cardioversion (50-100 J).
2. Stable patients with Afib for longer than 48 hours should be anticoagulated with heparin (80 units/kilogram IV followed by an infusion of 18 units/kilogram/h IV) before cardioversion. Consider a transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out atrial thrombus before cardioversion.
3. Control rate with diltiazem. Administer 20 milligrams (0.25 milligram/kilogram) IV over 2 min followed by a continuous IV infusion, 5 to 15 milligrams/h. Give a second dose of 25 milligrams (0.35 milligram/kilogram) in 15 min if the first dose fails to control rate. Alternative rate control agents include verapamil, 5 to 10 milligrams IV, metoprolol, 5 to 10 milligrams IV, and digoxin, 0.4 to 0.6 milligram IV. Treat patients with preexcitation syndromes (e.g., WPW) with procainamide, 17 milligrams/kilogram IV over 30 min up to 50 milligrams/kilogram or until 50% QRS widening is noted. Avoid β-adrenergic or calcium channel blockers due to the risk of causing degeneration to VF.
4. In patients with impaired cardiac function (EF < 40%), use amiodarone, 5 milligrams/kilogram IV over 30 min, followed by 1200 milligrams over...

24 hours (contraindicated in patients with iodine or shellfish allergy; increased risk of rhabdomyolysis if co-administered with simvastatin) or digoxin 0.4 to 0.6 milligram IV. 

Patients with Afib for shorter than 48 hours may be chemically or electrically cardioverted in the emergency department. Use amiodarone, ibutilide, procainamide, flecainide, or propafenone in patients with normal cardiac function. Ibutilide is dosed at 0.01 milligram/kilogram IV up to 1 milligram, infused over 10 min. A second ibutilide dose may be given if there is no response in 20 min. Ibutilide should not be administered to patients with known structural heart disease, hypokalemia, prolonged QTc intervals, hypomagnesemia, or CHF because of the possibility of provoking torsades de pointes. Monitor for 4 to 6 hours after giving ibutilide. Patients with impaired cardiac function may be cardioverted with amiodarone or electrically.

Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia (MAT) is defined as at least 3 different sites of atrial ectopy. The ECG characteristics of MAT are (a) 3 or more differently shaped P waves; (b) changing PP, PR, and RR intervals; and (c) atrial rhythm usually between 100 and 180 beats/min. MAT can be confused with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation (AFib). MAT is found most often in elderly patients with decompensated COPD, but it also may be found in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), sepsis, methylxanthine toxicity, or digoxin toxicity.

Emergency Department Care and Disposition:
1. Treat the underlying disorder.
2. Specific antiarrhythmic treatment is rarely indicated. Rate control may be achieved with verapamil 5 to 10 milligrams IV, or diltiazem 10 to 20 milligrams IV in patients with acute COPD or CHF exacerbations.
3. Magnesium sulfate 2 grams IV over 60 seconds followed by a constant infusion of 1 to 2 grams/h may decrease ectopy and convert MAT to sinus rhythm in some patients.
4. Replete potassium levels to greater than 4 mEq/L to increase myocardial membrane stability.

In patients with sinus bradycardia, SA node exit block or AV block, junctional escape beats may occur, usually at a rate between 40 and 60 beats/min. Junctional escape beats may conduct retrogradely into the atria, but the QRS complex usually will mask any retrograde P wave. Sustained junctional escape rhythms may be seen with CHF, myocarditis, acute MI (especially inferior MI), hyperkalemia, or digoxin toxicity. If the ventricular rate is too slow, myocardial or cerebral ischemia may develop. 

Emergency Department Care and Disposition:
1. Isolated, infrequent junctional escape beats usually do not require specific treatment.
2. If sustained junctional escape rhythms are producing symptoms, treat the underlying cause.
3. In unstable patients, give atropine 0.5 milligram IV every 5 min to a total of 2 milligrams.
4. Use transcutaneous or transvenous pacing in unstable patients not responsive to atropine.
5. Manage patients with digoxin toxicity as discussed for SVT.

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are due to impulses originating from single or multiple areas in the ventricles. The ECG characteristics of PVCs are: (a) a premature and wide QRS complex; (b) no preceding P wave; (c) the ST segment and T wave of the PVC are directed opposite the preceding major QRS deflection; (d) most PVCs do not affect the sinus node, so there is usually a fully compensatory post-ectopic pause; (e) many PVCs have a fixed coupling interval (within 0.04 second) from the preceding sinus beat; and (f) many PVCs are conducted into the atria, thus producing a retrograde P wave. If 3 or more PVCs occur in a row, patients are considered to have nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. PVCs are very common, occurring in most patients with ischemic heart disease.

Other common causes of PVCs include digoxin toxicity, CHF, hypokalemia, alkalosis, hypoxia, and sympathomimetic drugs. Pooled data and meta-analyses have found no reduction in mortality from suppressive or prophylactic treatment of PVCs. Ventricular parasystole occurs when the ectopic ventricular focus fires frequently enough to compete with the SA node and is associated with cardiac ischemia, electrolyte imbalance, and hypertensive or ischemic heart disease.

Emergency Department Care and Disposition:
1. Stable patients require no treatment.
2. Patients with 3 or more PVCs in a row should be managed as VT.
3. For hemodynamically unstable patients with PVCs, consider lidocaine 1 to 1.5 milligrams/kilogram IV (up to 3 milligrams/kilogram) unless the patient is allergic to amide anesthetics.

Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):
The ECG characteristics of AIVR are wide and regular QRS complexes; a rate between 40 and 100 beats/min, often close to the preceding sinus rate; mostly runs of short duration (3 to 30 beats/min); and an AIVR often beginning with a fusion beat. This condition is found most commonly with an acute MI or in the setting of reperfusion after successful thrombolysis. Treatment is not necessary. On occasion, AIVR may be the only functioning pacemaker, and suppression with lidocaine can lead to cardiac asystole.

Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):
VT is the occurrence of 3 or more successive beats from a ventricular ectopic pacemaker at a rate faster than 100 beats/min. The ECG characteristics of VT are a wide QRS complex, a rate faster than 100 beats/min (most commonly 150 to 200 beats/min), a regular rhythm, and a constant QRS axis. The most common causes of VT are ischemic heart disease and acute MI. Other etiologies include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse, drug toxicity (digoxin, antiarrhythmics, or sympathomimetics), hypoxia, hypokalemia, and hyperkalemia. In general, all wide complex tachycardia should be treated as VT regardless of clinical symptoms or initial vital signs. Adenosine appears to cause little harm in patients with VT; therefore, stable patients with wide complex tachycardia due to suspected SVT with aberrancy may be treated safely with adenosine when the diagnosis is in doubt. Atypical VT (torsade de pointes) occurs when the QRS axis swings from a positive to a negative direction in a single lead at a rate of 200 to 240 beats/min. Drugs that further prolong repolarization—quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, phenothiazines, and tricyclic antidepressants—exacerbate this arrhythmia.

Emergency Department Care and Disposition for VT:
1. Defibrillate pulseless VT with unsynchronized cardioversion starting at 100J. Treat unstable patients who are not pulseless with synchronized cardioversion.
2. Treat hemodynamically stable patients with amiodarone, 150 milligrams IV over 10 min with repeated boluses every 10 min up to a total of 2 grams. Alternatively, an infusion of 0.5 milligram/min over 18 hours may be given after the initial bolus. Second-line agents include procainamide (in patients without suspected MI or LV dysfunction) and lidocaine.
3. For patients with torsades de pointes: Try overdrive pacing set at 90 to 120 beats/min to terminate torsades de pointes.
4. Magnesium sulfate 1 to 2 grams IV over 60 to 90 seconds followed by an infusion of 1 to 2 grams/h can be effective.
5. Isoproterenol, 2 to 10 micrograms/min IV infusion, is also used in refractory torsades but carries a risk of increased myocardial oxygen demand.

Patients with wide-complex tachycardia should be approached as having VT until proven otherwise. Age over 35 years, a history of MI, CHF, or coronary artery bypass grafting strongly favors this diagnosis.

r VT. ECG signs favoring VT include A V dissociation, fusion beats, precordial lead QRS concordance, and a QRS duration longer than 0.14 second.  

Ventricular Fibrillation  
Clinical Features  
VF is the totally disorganized depolarization and contraction of small areas of ventricular myocardium during which there is no effective ventricular pumping activity. The ECG shows a fine-to-coarse zigzag pattern without discernible P waves or QRS complexes. VF is seen most commonly in patients with severe ischemic heart disease, with or without an acute MI. It also can be caused by digoxin or quinidine toxicity, hypothermia, chest trauma, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, or mechanical stimulation (eg, catheter wire). Primary VF occurs suddenly, without preceding hemodynamic deterioration, and usually is due to acute ischemia or peri-infarct scar reentry. Secondary VF occurs after a prolonged period of hemodynamic deterioration due to left ventricular failure or circulatory shock.  

Emergency Department Care and Disposition  
1. Perform immediate electrical defibrillation (unsynchronized) at 200 J (biphasic) and 360 J (monophasic). If VF persists, do 5 cycles of CPR, check pulse, and defibrillate again if no pulse is present. Keep defibrillation pads on the patient and in the same location because, with successive countershocks, transthoracic impedance decreases.  
2. If the initial 2 cycles of CPR and defibrillation are unsuccessful, administer antiarrhythmic treatment using amiodarone 300 milligrams IV push. Lidocaine is second-line and is dosed at 1.5 milligrams/kilogram IV followed by 0.75 milligram/kilogram IV for two more doses. Repeat the CPR-defibrillation cycle.  
3. If no pulse is present after the third CPR-defibrillation cycle, give epinephrine 1 milligram IV push, or vasopressin 40 units IV push (1 time only), followed by a 20-mL normal saline flush and immediate resumption of the CPR-defibrillation cycle.  
4. In refractory VF, administer magnesium sulfate 1 to 2 grams IV over 60 to 90 seconds followed by an infusion of 1 to 2 grams/h.  

CONDUCTION DISTURBANCES  
Atrioventricular (AV) Block  
First-degree AV block is characterized by a delay in AV conduction, manifested by a prolonged PR interval (> 0.2 second). It can be found in normal hearts and in association with increased vagal tone, digoxin toxicity, inferior MI, amyloid, and myocarditis. First-degree AV block needs no treatment. Second-degree AV block is characterized by intermittent AV nodal conduction: some atrial impulses reach the ventricles, whereas others are blocked, thereby causing “grouped beating.” These blocks can be subdivided into nodal blocks which are typically reversible and infranodal blocks which are due to irreversible conduction system disease. Third-degree AV block is characterized by complete interruption in AV conduction with resulting AV dissociation.  

Second-Degree Mobitz I (Wenckebach) AV Block  
Clinical Features  
Mobitz I AV block is a nodal block causing a progressive prolongation of conduction through the AV node until the atrial impulse is completely blocked. Usually, only one atrial impulse is blocked at a time. After the dropped beat, the AV conduction returns to normal and the cycle usually repeats itself with the same conduction ratio (fixed ratio) or a different conduction ratio (variable ratio). Although the PR intervals progressively lengthen before the dropped beat, the increments by which they lengthen decrease with successive beats causing a progressive shortening of each successive R–R interval before the dropped beat. This block is often transient and usually associated with an acute inferior MI, digoxin toxicity, or myocarditis or can be seen after cardiac surgery. Because the blockade occurs at the level of the AV node itself rather than at the infranodal conducting system, this is usually a stable rhythm.  

Emergency Department Care and Disposition  
1. Specific treatment is not necessary unless slow ventricular rates produce signs of hypoperfusion.  
2. In cases associated with acute inferior MI, provide adequate volume resuscitation before initiating further interventions.  
3. Administer atropine 0.5 milligram IV repeated every 5 min. Titrate to the desired heart rate or until the total dose reaches 2 milligrams.  
4. Although rarely needed, transcutaneous pacing may be used.  

Second-Degree Mobitz II AV Block  
Clinical Features  
Mobitz II AV block is typically due to infranodal disease, causing a constant PR interval with intermittent non-conducted atrial beats.

This block indicates significant damage or dysfunction of the infranodal conduction system; therefore, the QRS complexes are usually wide coming from the low His-Purkinje bundle or the ventricles. Type II blocks are more dangerous than type I blocks because they are usually permanent and may progress suddenly to complete heart block, especially in the setting of an acute anterior MI, and almost always require permanent cardiac pacemaker placement. When second-degree AV block occurs with a fixed conduction ratio of 2:1, it is not possible to differentiate between a Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) and Mobitz type II block.

Emergency Department Care and Disposition:
1. Atropine 0.5 to 1 milligram IV bolus repeated every 5 min as needed up to 2 milligrams total dose is first-line treatment for symptomatic patients. All patients should have transcutaneous pacing pads positioned and ready for use in the case of further deterioration into complete heart block.
2. Initiate transcutaneous cardiac pacing in patients unresponsive to atropine.
3. If transcutaneous pacing is unsuccessful, initiate transvenous pacing (0.2 to 20 mA at 40 to 140 beats/min via a semi-floating or balloon-tipped pacing catheter).

Third-Degree (Complete) AV Block:
In third-degree AV block, there is no AV conduction. The ventricles are paced by an escape pacemaker from the AV node or infranodal conduction system at a rate slower than the atrial rate. When third-degree AV block occurs at the AV node, a junctional escape pacemaker takes over with a ventricular rate of 40 to 60 beats/min; and, because the rhythm originates from above the bifurcation of the His bundle, the QRS complexes are narrow. Nodal third-degree AV block may develop in up to 8% of acute inferior MIs and it is usually transient, although it may last for several days. 

When third-degree AV block occurs at the infranodal level, the ventricles are driven by a ventricular escape rhythm at a rate slower than 40 beats/min. Third-degree AV block located in the bundle branch or the Purkinje system invariably has an escape rhythm with a wide QRS complex. Like Mobitz type II block, this indicates structural damage to the infranodal conduction system and can be seen in acute anterior MIs. The ventricular escape pacemaker is usually inadequate to maintain cardiac output and is unstable with periods of ventricular asystole.

Emergency Department Care and Disposition:
1. Perform transcutaneous cardiac pacing in unstable patients until a transvenous pacemaker can be placed.
2. In stable patients, apply transcutaneous pacing pads. Treat the same as second-degree Mobitz II AV block.

Fascicular Blocks:
Conduction blocks may arise in one or more of the three infranodal conduction pathways. Blockage of either of the left fascicles does not prolong the QRS duration, but will change the QRS axis. Left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) causes left axis deviation while left posterior fascicular block (LPFB) causes right axis deviation. Right bundle branch block (RBBB) will prolong the QRS duration (> 0.12 sec) and cause a RSR in the early precordial leads (V1-2). Bifascicular block denotes a combination of any two of these fascicles, the most notable of which is left bundle branch block (LAFB + LPFB). Trifascicular block denotes the presence of first degree AV block in the presence of a bifascicular block and is indicative of significant conduction system disease that includes the AV node, thus increasing the risk of Mobitz II or third-degree AV block and the potential need for permanent pacemaker placement.

Conduction Abnormalities that Can Cause Rhythm Disturbances:
Brugada syndrome and long-QT syndrome increase the risk of spontaneous VT/VF and require evaluation for implantable cardiac defibrillator placement when diagnosed. Brugada syndrome is a genetic disorder of fast sodium channels causing a RBBB-pattern in the early precordial leads (V1-2) with a pathognomonic J-point elevation and saddle-shaped or sloped ST segment. Long QT syndrome is characterized by a QT interval > 470 msec in men and > 480 msec in women and may be congenital or acquired, leading to an increased risk of torsades de pointes.

Preterminal Rhythms:
Pulseless Electrical Activity:
Pulseless electrical activity is the presence of electrical complexes without accompanying mechanical contraction of the heart. Potential mechanical causes should be diagnosed and treated, including severe hypovolemia, cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, massive pulmonary embolus, MI.

nd toxic ingestions (eg, tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, β-blockers). In addition, profound metabolic abnormalities such as acidosis, hypoxia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, and hypothermia also should be considered and treated. After intubation and initiating CPR, administer epinephrine, 1 milligram IV/IO (1:10 000 solution) every 3 to 5 min. If giving via endotracheal tube, increase the dose 2 to 2.5 times and follow with several rapid ventilations to disperse the drug. Treatment is guided by rapid identification and treatment of the underlying cause. Use agents with α-adrenergic activity, such as norepinephrine and phenylephrine, to improve vascular tone when indicated. Electrical pacing is not effective.

Idioventricular rhythm is a ventricular escape rhythm at slower than 40 beats/min with a QRS wider than 0.16 second. It is associated with infranodal AV block, massive MI, cardiac tamponade, and exsanguinating hemorrhage. After intubation and initiating CPR, treatment includes identifying contributing mechanical factors (eg, aggressive volume resuscitation) and α-adrenergic agents.

Asystole is the complete absence of cardiac electrical activity and carries a grim prognosis. Treatment is the same as that for pulseless electrical activity.

Pacemakers, AICDs, or combination units may be used in patients with a history of sudden death, heart failure, or cardiomyopathy. Malfunction can occur at any level of the device, including infection or hematoma in the pocket housing the device, lead infection/displacement, failure to pace, failure to sense, overpacing, or inappropriate defibrillation. Most pacemakers will have a magnetic switch which, when triggered by magnet application to the unit, will cause the pacemaker to function in a fixed asynchronous mode.

Evaluation should include an ECG, electrolytes, and chest x-ray to assess lead position and integrity. Arrangements should be made for electrical interrogation of the unit. Patients with pacing failure may require treatment based on their underlying rhythm and associated symptoms. Patients with overpacing may require magnet application to convert the pacemaker to asynchronous mode pacing at a lower rate.

Children primarily develop cardiac arrest secondary to hypoxia from respiratory arrest or shock syndromes. Because of age and size differences among children, drug dosages, compression and respiratory rates, and equipment sizes differ considerably.

The airway in infants and children is smaller, variable in size, and more anterior than that in the adult. The prominent occiput and relatively large tongue and epiglottis may lead to obstruction when the child is in the supine position. Mild extension of the head in the sniffing position opens the airway. Chin lift or jaw thrust maneuvers may relieve obstruction of the airway related to the tongue. Oral airways are not commonly used in pediatrics but may be useful in the unconscious child who requires continuous jaw thrust or chin lift to maintain airway patency. Oral airways are inserted by direct visualization with a tongue blade. A bag-valve-mask system is commonly used for ventilation. Minimum volume for ventilation bags for infants and children is 450 mL. The tidal volume necessary to ventilate children is 10 to 15 mL/kilogram. Observation of chest rise and auscultation of breath sounds will ensure adequate ventilation. Endotracheal intubation usually is performed with a Miller straight blade with a properly sized tube. Resuscitation measuring tapes have been found to be the most accurate for determining tube size. The formula 16 plus age in years divided by 4 calculates approximate tube size. Uncuffed tubes are used in children up to 8 years. 

Initiate ventilation at 20 breaths/min for infants, 15 breaths/min for young children, and 10 breaths/min for adolescents unless hyperventilation is required.

Rapid sequence intubation is the administration of an intravenous (IV) induction agent with a neuromuscular blocking agent to facilitate endotracheal intubation.

Check equipment function. Preoxygenate the patient with 100% oxygen. In children, cricoid pressure can occlude the pliable trachea. Release cricoid pressure, if applied, if laryngoscopy and intubation are difficult. Refer to Table 3-2 for specific induction and paralytic agents used in children.

TABLE 3-2 Common Rapid-Sequence Intubation Medications in Children  
Medication Dose Comments  
Induction agents  
Etomidate 0.3 milligram/kilogram Preserves hemodynamic stability; may suppress adrenal axis even in a single dose; short acting, requires anxiolysis or analgesia after intubation  
Ketamine 1–2 milligrams/kilogram Bronchodilator, preserves respiratory drive, cardiovascular stimulant; drug of choice for intubation for asthma  
Propofol 1–2 milligrams/kilogram Rapid push, higher dose in infants, may cause hypotension; short acting, requires ongoing anxiolysis or analgesia after intubation  

Paralytics  
Rocuronium 1 milligram/kilogram Nondepolarizing agent; longer duration than succinylcholine  
Succinylcholine < 10 kilograms: 1.5–2.0 milligrams/kilogram > 10 kilograms: 1.0–1.5 milligrams/kilogram Shorter duration than rocuronium; better intubating conditions at 60 s; may cause bradycardia in children and hyperkalemic cardiac arrest in children with undiagnosed neuromuscular disease  

Sedatives  
Midazolam 0.1 milligram/kilogram Short-acting sedative  
Lorazepam 0.1 milligram/kilogram Longer-acting sedative  

Analgesics  
Fentanyl 1–2 micrograms/kilogram Short-acting analgesic; preserves hemodynamic stability  
Morphine 0.1–0.2 milligram/kilogram Longer-acting analgesic; may cause histamine release  

Premedication is no longer routinely recommended in children due to a lack of supporting evidence. Rapid-sequence intubation medications can be given IO when IV access cannot be obtained.

Intubate the trachea, confirm proper placement, and secure the tube. Atropine 0.02 milligram/kilogram (minimum dose, 0.1 milligram; maximum dose, 1 milligram) may be used for symptomatic reflex bradycardia.

Vascular Access  
Airway management is paramount in pediatric arrest and should not be delayed while obtaining vascular access. Try peripheral veins (antecubital, hand, foot, or scalp) first. Intraosseous access is also a quick, safe, and reliable route for administering fluids and resuscitation medications. The proximal tibia is the most commonly used site. If peripheral IV or IO is unsuccessful, percutaneous access of the femoral vein or saphenous vein cutdown may be attempted. 

There are several manual and mechanical devices available for IO insertion. The insertion site is 1 to 3 cm below the anterior tibial tuberosity and in the middle of the anteromedial surface of the tibia. Using sterile technique, insert the device to penetrate the cortex. Then, remove the cannula from the needle, confirm needle placement by aspirating bone marrow or infusing 5 to 10 cc of saline, and secure the device. 

Begin fluid resuscitation with rapid infusion of isotonic saline, 20 mL/kilogram IV bolus. Repeat as needed. If shock or hypotension persist after several boluses, consider initiating a pressor.

Proper drug dosages in children require knowledge of the patient’s weight. Use a length-based system when an exact weight is unavailable. The rule of 6s may be used to quickly calculate continuous infusions of drugs such as dopamine and dobutamine. The calculation is 6 milligrams times weight in kilogram: fill to 100 mL with 5% dextrose in water. The infusion rate in mL per hour equals the micrograms per kilogram per hour.

min rate (ie, an infusion running at 1 mL/h = 1 microgram/kilogram/min, or 5 mL/h = 5 micrograms/kilogram/min). 

Epinephrine is indicated in pulseless arrest and in hypoxia-induced bradycardia unresponsive to oxygenation and ventilation. The initial dose is 0.01 milligram/kilogram (0.1 mL/kilogram of 1:10,000 solution) IV/IO or 0.1 milligram/kilogram (0.1 mL/kilogram) of 1:1,000 solution by endotracheal route. Subsequent doses may be administered every 3 to 5 min as needed. Consider sodium bicarbonate if ventilation, epinephrine, and chest compressions fail to correct acidosis. 

Calcium may be useful in treating hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and calcium-channel blocker overdose. Calcium may be given as calcium chloride, 20 milligrams/kilogram (0.2 milligram/kilogram of 10% solution), or calcium gluconate, 60 to 100 milligrams/kilogram (0.6-1 milligram/kilogram of 10% solution), via IV or IO route.  

Dysrhythmias in infants and children are most often the result of respiratory insufficiency or hypoxia. Careful attention to oxygenation and ventilation, along with correction of hypoxia, acidosis, and fluid balance, are the cornerstones of dysrhythmia management in children. 

TABLE 3-3 Treatment of Pediatric Bradycardia
1. If bradycardia causing cardiorespiratory compromise:
   a. Provide oxygen and/or ventilation as necessary.
   b. If heart rate remains bradycardic (< 60) with poor perfusion, begin CPR.
2. If symptomatic bradycardia persists, administer epinephrine 0.01 milligram/kilogram (0.1 mL/kilogram of 1:10,000 concentration) IV/IO and repeat every 3 to 5 min as necessary. ET epinephrine 0.1 milligram/kilogram (0.1 mL of 1:1,000 concentration) may be used if IV access is unavailable. If bradycardia is due to increased vagal tone or primary AV conduction block, give atropine: 0.02 milligram/kilogram (minimum dose, 0.1 milligram; maximum dose, 1 milligram); may repeat.
3. Consider emergency pacing in patients with complete heart block or sinus node dysfunction unresponsive to oxygenation, ventilation, chest compressions, and medications.
4. Identify and treat the underlying cause.

TABLE 3-4 Treatment of Pediatric Pulseless Arrest
1. Initiate BLS; CPR; administer oxygen, attach monitor/defibrillator if available. If after any of the steps below the rhythm becomes stable, begin post-resuscitation efforts.
2. If rhythm is shockable, ie, ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT):
   a. Defibrillate once w/ 2 J/kilogram; may use pediatric AED if > 1 y/o (1-8 year olds); Check rhythm.
   b. If unstable cardiac rhythm persists, resume CPR for 5 cycles. Interrupt only to administer 4 J/kilogram (may use pediatric AED) for VF/VT. Give epinephrine 0.01 milligram/kilogram (0.1 mL of 1:10,000 concentration) IV/IO and repeat every 3-5 min as necessary. ET epinephrine 0.1 milligram/kilogram (0.1 mL of 1:1,000 concentration) may be used if IV access is unavailable. Check rhythm.
   c. If unstable cardiac rhythm persists, resume CPR for 5 cycles. Interrupt only to administer 4 J/kilogram (may use pediatric AED) for VF/VT. Consider amiodarone 5 milligrams/kilogram IV/IO, lidocaine 1 milligram/kilogram IV/IO, magnesium 25-50 milligrams/kilogram IV/IO. Treat reversible causes. Check rhythm.
   d. Repeat steps b and c until stable rhythm or decision to discontinue resuscitation.
3. If rhythm is not shockable, ie asystole:
   a. Resume CPR. Give epinephrine 0.01 milligram/kilogram (0.1 mL of 1:10,000 concentration) IV/IO and repeat every 3-5 min as necessary. ET epinephrine 0.1 milligram/kilogram (0.1 mL of 1:1,000 concentration) may be used if IV access is unavailable. Check rhythm.
   b. If asystole persists, repeat step above until a treatable rhythm develops or decision to discontinue resuscitation.

TABLE 3-5 Treatment of Pediatric Tachycardia With Poor Perfusion
Provide oxygen and ventilation as necessary. Attach monitor/defibrillator if available; perform ECG and evaluate QRS duration.
NARROW COMPLEX QRS (< 0.09 sec)
Sinus tachycardia:
   a. Identify and treat underlying cause.
   b. ECG reveals normal P waves, variable R-R intervals, constant P-R intervals; infant rate usually < 220 bpm; child rate usually < 180 bpm.
Supraventricular tachycardia:
   a. Try vagal maneuvers first; if unsuccessful, administer adenosine, 0.1 milligram/kilogram (maximum, 6 milligrams) by rapid IV push; if unsuccessful, double dose to 0.2 milligram/kilogram (maximum, 12 milligrams).
   b. Another option is synchronized cardioversion, 0.5-1 J/kilogram. If unsuccessful, double to 1-2 J/kilogram. Sedate patient, if possible.
   c. EKG reveals absent/abnormal P waves, HR not variable (infant rate usually > 220 bpm; child rate usually > 180 bpm).
WIDE COMPLEX QRS (≥ 0.09 sec)

Ventricular tachycardia:
1. Perform synchronized cardioversion, 0.5-1 J/kilogram. Sedate if possible. Consider giving adenosine if electrical cardioversion is not delayed.
2. Other options include amiodarone, 5 milligrams/kilogram IV over 20-60 min or procainamide, 15 milligrams/kilogram IV over 30-60 min.
3. Expert consultation is advised.

The most common rhythm seen in pediatric arrest is bradycardia leading to asystole. Oxygenation and ventilation will often correct this problem. Epinephrine may be useful if the child is unresponsive to this respiratory intervention.

The next most common dysrhythmia in children is narrow complex supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), with rates between 250 and 350 beats per min. On EKG, p waves are either absent or abnormal. It may be difficult to distinguish between a fast sinus tachycardia and SVT. The presence of normal p waves is strongly suggestive of sinus tachycardia rather than SVT. Young infants may have sinus tachycardia with rates faster than 200 beats/min. Patients with sinus tachycardia may have a history of fever, dehydration, or shock, while SVT is usually associated with a vague, nonspecific history.

Defibrillation and Cardioversion:
Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are rare in children. When present, immediate defibrillation at 2 J/kilogram is recommended followed by 1 to 2 min of CPR (5 cycles of 15:2 compressions and ventilations) to restore coronary perfusion and improve oxygen delivery to the myocardium before additional attempts at defibrillation. If the first defibrillation attempt is unsuccessful, double the energy to 4 J/kilogram for each subsequent attempt.

Synchronized cardioversion, 0.5 J/kilogram, is used to treat other unstable tachydysrhythmias. Double the energy level to 1 J/kilogram if the first attempt is unsuccessful. Use the largest pads or paddles that still allow contact of the entire paddle with the chest wall. When using paddles, electrode cream or paste is used to prevent burns. One paddle is placed on the right of the sternum at the second intercostal space, and the other is placed at the left midclavicular line at the level of the xiphoid.

Neonatal Resuscitation:
1. The first step in neonatal resuscitation is to maintain body temperature. Dry the infant and place on a radiant warmer. If available, place the limbs and torso of very-low-birth-weight newborns (< 1500 grams) in specially developed polyethylene bags to help maintain normothermia.
2. Reserve immediate suctioning for babies who have obvious obstruction to spontaneous breathing or who require positive-pressure ventilation. If needed, suction the mouth and then the nose with a bulb syringe or mechanical suction device. Routine deep suctioning is not recommended as it may result in vagally induced bradycardia.
3. Aspiration of meconium-stained amniotic fluid may result in both morbidity and mortality. If the infant is vigorous after delivery, do not suction the mouth, nares, or airway. If the infant is depressed after delivery, perform direct tracheal suctioning using direct laryngoscopic visualization and an endotracheal tube fitted with a meconium-suctioning adapter. If attempted intubation is prolonged and unsuccessful, abandon further attempts and begin bag-mask ventilation if the heart rate is < 100 beats/min.
4. Assess heart rate, respiratory effort, color, and activity quickly over the next 5 to 10 seconds. If the infant is apneic or the heart rate is slow (< 100 beats/min), administer positive-pressure ventilation using bag-mask ventilation. For term babies, begin resuscitation with room air rather than 100% oxygen. Use pulse oximetry to guide the use of supplementary oxygen. If the baby is bradycardic (HR< 60 beats/min) after 90 seconds of resuscitation with room air or with blended oxygen, increase the oxygen concentration to 100% until heart rate is normalized. Provide assisted ventilation at rates of 40 to 60 breaths/min. Begin with an inflation pressure of about 20 cm H2O. Pressures as high as 30 to 40 cm H2O may be required initially in some term infants if chest rise is inadequate and the baby is not responding. However, high inflation pressures may result in pneumothorax, especially in premature infants.
5. If no improvement is noted after 30 seconds of bag-mask ventilation or the infant’s condition deteriorates further, perform endotracheal intubation and ventilation. CO2 detectors aid in determining whether the baby is properly intubated but color change is dependent on adequate circulation. Proper tube placement can also be determined by noting good chest rise, visualization of vapor steam in the endotracheal tube, and auscultation.
6. If the heart rate is still slower than 60 beats/min...

After intubation and assisted ventilation for 30 seconds, begin cardiac compressions at 90 chest compressions and 30 breaths each minute (3:1 ratio). The ‘2 thumb-encircling hands’ technique is preferred to the ‘2-finger’ technique when performing chest compressions. If there is still no improvement in heart rate, initiate drug therapy. Vascular access may be obtained peripherally or via the umbilical vein. The most expedient procedure in the neonate is to place a catheter in the umbilical vein and advance to 10 to 12 cm or until free flow of blood is seen in the catheter. Push epinephrine, 0.01 to 0.03 milligram/kilogram of 1:10,000 solution IV, which equals 0.1 to 0.3 mL/kilogram, if the heart rate is still slower than 60 beats/min despite adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Repeat every 3 to 5 min if necessary. IV administration is preferred to intratracheal administration. Initiate volume expansion with normal saline (or Type O/Rh negative blood, if available), 10 to 20 mL/kilogram, if hypovolemia is suspected on the basis of pallor, slow capillary refill time, weak pulses, and/or inadequate response to other measures. Sodium bicarbonate during neonatal resuscitation remains controversial and is generally not administered during initial resuscitation. A dose of 1 mEq/kilogram of a 4.2% solution (0.5 mEq/mL) IV may be given if there is a significant metabolic acidosis; this therapy should be guided by blood gas values. Naloxone is not recommended in the resuscitation for newborns with respiratory depression.

When altered, fluids and electrolytes should be corrected in the following order: (a) volume; (b) pH; (c) potassium, calcium, and magnesium; and (d) sodium and chloride. Reestablishment of tissue perfusion often equilibrates the fluid-electrolyte and acid-base balances. Because the osmolarity of normal saline (NS) matches that of serum, it is an excellent fluid for volume replacement. Hypotonic fluids such as 5% dextrose in water (D5W) should never be used to replace volume. Lactated Ringer solution is commonly used for surgical patients or trauma patients; however, only NS can be given in the same line with blood components. D5½NS, with or without potassium, is given as a maintenance fluid. The more concentrated dextrose solutions, D10W or D20W, are used for patients with compromised ability to mobilize glucose stores, such as patients with hepatic failure, or as part of total parenteral nutrition solutions.

Volume loss and dehydration can be inferred by the patient history. Historical features include: vomiting, diarrhea, fever, adverse working conditions, decreased fluid intake, chronic disease, altered level of consciousness, and reduced urine output. Tachycardia and hypotension are late signs of dehydration. On physical examination, one may find dry mucosa, shrunken tongue (excellent indicator), and decreased skin turgor. In infants and children, sunken fontanelles, decreased capillary refill, lack of tears, and decreased wet diapers are typical signs and symptoms of dehydration. Lethargy and coma are more ominous signs and may indicate a significant comorbid condition. Laboratory values are not reliable indicators of fluid status. Plasma and urine osmolarity are perhaps the most reliable measures of dehydration. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, hematocrit, and other chemistries are insensitive.

Volume overload is a purely clinical diagnosis and presents with edema (central or peripheral), respiratory distress (pulmonary edema), and jugular venous distention (in congestive heart failure). The significant risk factors for volume overload are renal, cardiovascular, and liver diseases. Blood pressure does not necessarily correlate with volume status alone; patients with volume overload can present with hypotension or hypertension.

Maintenance fluids:
- Adult: D5½NS at 75 to 125 mL/h + 20 mEq/L potassium chloride for an average adult (approximately 70 kilograms).
- Children: D5½NS or D10½NS, 100 mL/kilogram/d for the first 10 kilograms of body weight, 50 mL/kilogram/d for the second 10 kilograms, and 20 mL/kilogram/d for every kilogram thereafter.

be the only intervention needed because most electrolytes exist in equilibrium with others. Abnormalities should be corrected at the same rate they develop; however, slower correction is usually safe unless the condition warrants rapid or early intervention (eg, hypoglycemia or hyperkalemia). Evaluation of electrolyte disorders frequently requires a comparison of the measured and calculated osmolarities (number of particles per liter of solution). To calculate osmolarity, measured serum values in mEq/L are used: 
osmolarity (mOsm/L) = 2 [Na + ] + (glucose/18) + (BUN/2.8) + (ETOH/4.6) 

Hyponatremia ([Na + ] < 135 mEq/L)  
Clinical Features  
The clinical manifestations of hyponatremia occur when the [Na + ] drops below 120 mEq/L; they include nausea, weakness, headache, agitation, hallucinations, cramps, confusion, lethargy, and seizures.  

Diagnosis and Differential  
Evaluate volume status and measured and calculated serum osmolarities. True hyponatremia presents with reduced osmolarity and is further differentiated based on volume status and urine [Na + ]. This state results from primary water gain, [Na+] loss greater than that of water, or alteration in the distribution of water. Factitious hyponatremia (false low measurement of the serum sodium) is due to hyperglycemia, hyperproteinemia, hyperlipidemia, and other osmotically active solutes and is associated with a normal to high osmolarity. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, characterized by hyponatremia, inappropriately elevated urine osmolality despite low serum osmolarity, elevated urine sodium, and clinical euvolemia, is a diagnosis of exclusion. Causes of hyponatremia are listed in Table 4-1. 

Emergency Department Care and Disposition  
1. Correct existing volume or perfusion deficits with NS.  
2. In euvolemic or hypervolemic patients, restrict fluids (500 to 1500 mL of water daily).  
3. In severe hyponatremia ([Na + ] <120 mEq/L) that has developed rapidly with central nervous system (CNS) changes such as coma or seizures, give hypertonic saline, 3% NS (513 mEq/L), at 25 to 100 mL/h. The [Na + ] should not be corrected faster than 0.5 mEq/L/h in chronic hyponatremia or 1.0 mEq/L/h in acute hyponatremia. The [Na + ] correction should not exceed 12 mEq/L/day.  
4. The sodium dose can be calculated as follows: weight (kilograms) × 0.6 × (desired [Na + ] − measured [Na + ]) = sodium deficit (mEq).  
5. Complications of rapid correction include congestive heart failure (CHF) and central pontine myelinolysis.  

Hypernatremia ([Na + ] > 150 mEq/L)  
Clinical Features  
An osmolarity increase of 2% stimulates thirst to prevent hypernatremia. Symptoms of hypernatremia are usually noticeable at a serum osmolarity > 350 or [Na + ] > 158 mEq/L. Initial symptoms include irritability, tremulousness, and ataxia. Lethargy, coma, and seizures may be seen with osmolarities above 400. Morbidity and mortality are highest in infants and the elderly who may be unable to respond to increased thirst.  

Diagnosis and Differential  
Hypernatremia is most commonly caused by a decrease in total body water due to decreased intake or excessive loss. It is less often due to an increase in total body [Na + ]. Common causes are GI loss, hyperpyrexia, and excessive sweating. An important etiology of hypernatremia is diabetes insipidus (DI), which results in the loss of hypotonic urine. Central DI (no antidiuretic hormone secreted) results from CNS disease, surgery, or trauma. Nephrogenic DI (unresponsive to antidiuretic hormone) results from congenital disease, drugs, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, or renal disease. The causes of hypernatremia are listed in Table 4-2.

Key: ADH = antidiuretic hormone, CNS = central nervous system.

1. Correct existing volume or perfusion deficits with NS or Lactated Ringer solution. Free water deficits are corrected with ½ NS. Avoid lowering the [Na+] more than 10 mEq/L/day.  
2. Each liter of water deficit causes the [Na+] to increase 3 to 5 mEq/L. Use the formula to calculate the free water deficit: water deficit (L) = (measured [Na+] / desired [Na+]) − 1.  
3. If no urine output is observed after NS or lactated Ringer solution rehydration, rapidly switch to ½ NS: unload the body of the extra sodium by using a diuretic (e.g., furosemide 20 to 40 milligrams IV).  
4. Central diabetes insipidus (DI) is treated with desmopressin with careful monitoring of electrolytes, urine osmolarity, and specific gravity. Consult a specialist.  
5. In children with a serum sodium level higher than 180 mEq/L, consider peritoneal dialysis using high-glucose, low-[Na+] dialysate in consultation with a pediatric nephrologist.

**Hypokalemia ([K+] < 3.5 mEq/L)**  
Clinical Features: The signs and symptoms of hypokalemia usually occur at levels below 2.5 mEq/L and affect the CNS (weakness, cramps, hyporeflexia, paresthesias), gastrointestinal system (ileus), cardiovascular system (dysrhythmias, worsening of digoxin toxicity, hypotension or hypertension, U waves, ST-segment depression, and prolonged QT interval), and renal system (metabolic alkalosis and increased ammonia production); glucose intolerance also can develop.  

Diagnosis and Differential: Causes can be grouped by decreased [K+] intake, increased [K+] excretion, or transcellular shift. The most common cause is the use of loop diuretics.  

Emergency Department Care and Disposition:  
1. A 20 mEq/dose [K+] will raise the [K+] by 0.25 mEq/L.  
2. In stable patients, oral replacement is preferred (safe and rapid); a 20 to 40 mEq [K+] dose is used.  
3. In unstable patients, IV Potassium chloride (KCl in doses of 10 to 20 mEq/h may be given). Add no more than 40 mEq of KCl to each liter of IV fluid. Infusion rates should not exceed 40 mEq/hr. Doses greater than 20 mEq/h should be given through a central line. Patients should be monitored continuously for dysrhythmias.  

**Hyperkalemia ([K+] > 5.5 mEq/L)**  
Clinical Features: The most concerning and serious manifestations of hyperkalemia are the cardiac effects. At levels of 6.5 to 7.5 mEq/L, the electrocardiogram (ECG) shows peaked T waves (precordial leads) and prolonged PR and short QT intervals. At levels of 7.5 to 8.0 mEq/L, the QRS widens and the P wave flattens. At levels above 8 mEq/L, a sine-wave pattern, ventricular fibrillation, and heart blocks occur. Neuromuscular symptoms include weakness and paralysis. Gastrointestinal symptoms include vomiting, colic, and diarrhea.  

Diagnosis and Differential: Beware of pseudohyperkalemia, which is caused by hemolysis after blood draws. Renal failure with oliguria is the most common cause of true hyperkalemia. Appropriate tests for management include an ECG, electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, arterial blood gases (check for acidosis), urine analysis, and a digoxin level in appropriate patients.  

Emergency Department Care and Disposition:  
1. Symptomatic patients are treated in a stepwise approach: stabilize the cardiac membrane with CaCl2 or Ca-gluconate; shift [K+] into the cell using glucose and insulin and/or bicarbonate and/or albuterol; enhance [K+] excretion by using sodium.

m polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), diuretics, or dialysis in severe cases. For levels over 7.0 mEq/L or if there are any ECG changes, give: IV calcium chloride (10%) 5 to 10 mL or IV calcium gluconate (10%) 10 to 20 mL. In children, give calcium gluconate (10%) 0.5 mL/kilogram. The presence of digoxin toxicity with hyperkalemia is an indication for digoxin immune Fab therapy. Avoid using calcium.

TABLE 4-4 Causes of Hyperkalemia
- Factitious: Laboratory error, Hemolysis and leukocytosis
- Increased plasma [K+] load: 
  - Exogenous: diet, salt substitutes, [K+] containing medications
  - Endogenous: hemolysis, GI bleeding, catabolic states, crush injury
- Decreased [K+] excretion: 
  - Renal failure, Impaired renin-aldosterone axis, Addison disease, Primary hypoaldosteronism, Other (heparin, ACE inhibitors, prostaglandin inhibitors)
  - Tubular potassium secretory defect: Sickle cell disease, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Postrenal transplantation, Obstructive uropathy, Potassium sparing diuretics
- Abnormal potassium distribution: 
  - Insulin deficiency, Hypertonicity (hyperglycemia), β-Adrenergic blockers, Exercise, Drugs: succinylcholine, β-agonists, digitalis intoxication, Acidosis

In acidotic patients, consider giving 50 to 100 mEq of sodium bicarbonate slow IV. In children, 1 to 2 mEq/kilogram is given slow IV. Give 50 mL (25 grams) of D50W with 10 to 20 units regular insulin IV push (5 to 10 units in dialysis patients). In children, give 0.5 to 1 gram/kilogram of glucose as D10W plus insulin 0.1 units/kilogram. Diuresis is maintained with furosemide 20 to 40 milligrams IV. Kayexalate (PO or rectal [PR]) 1 gram binds 1 mEq [K+]. Administer Kayexalate 15 to 30g PO with sorbitol or 30 to 50 grams PR with sorbitol. Sorbitol is used because Kayexalate is constipating. Kayexalate can exacerbate CHF. In children, give Kayexalate 1 gram/kilogram PO or PR. In patients with acute renal failure, consult a nephrologist for emergent dialysis. Albuterol 5 to 10 milligrams by nebulization may also be used to lower [K+]. Kayexalate and insulin/glucose therapies last several hours; all other therapies (except hemodialysis) have transient effects. Frequent monitoring of [K+] should occur.

Hypocalcemia ([Ca2+] < 8.5 mEq/L or ionized level < 2.0 mEq/L)
Clinical Features: The signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia are usually seen with ionized [Ca2+] levels below 1.5 mEq/L. Symptoms include paresthesias, increased deep tendon reflexes (DTRs), cramps, weakness, confusion, and seizures. Patients may demonstrate the Chvostek sign or the Trousseau sign. Alkalosis decreases the ionized [Ca2+] fraction without changing the total calcium level. Low [Ca2+] decreases myocardial contractility, so patients may present with CHF or prolonged QT intervals on the ECG.

Diagnosis and Differential: Causes include shock, sepsis, fat embolism, renal failure, pancreatitis, drugs (usually cimetidine), hypoparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, vitamin D deficiency, hypomagnesemia, and fluoride poisoning.

Emergency Department Care and Disposition:
1. If asymptomatic, use calcium gluconate tablets 1 to 4 grams/d PO divided every 6 hours with or without vitamin D (calcitriol 0.2 micrograms two times a day). Milk is not a good substitute.
2. In symptomatic patients or those with severe hypocalcemia, give calcium gluconate or calcium chloride, 10 mL 10% solution IV slowly over 10 min.
3. Replace magnesium in conjunction with [Ca2+].

Hypercalcemia ([Ca2+] > 10.5 mEq/L or ionized [Ca2+] > 2.7 mEq/L)
Several factors affect the serum calcium level: parathyroid hormone increases calcium and decreases phosphate; calcitonin and vitamin D metabolites decrease calcium. Decreased [H+] causes a decrease in ionized [Ca2+]. A decrease in albumin causes a decrease in [Ca2+] but not in the ionized portion.

Clinical Features: Clinical signs and symptoms develop at levels above 12 milligrams/dL. Patients often have profound volume depletion; concomitant electrolyte abnormalities are frequent. A mnemonic to aid recall of common hypercalcemia symptoms is stones (renal calculi), bones (osteolysis), psychic moans (lethargy, weakness, fatigue, and confusion), and abdominal groans (abdominal pain, constipation, polyuria, and polydipsia). ECG changes include depressed ST segments, widened T waves, shortened QT intervals, and heart block.

Diagnosis and Differential  
Most cases of hypercalcemia are due to hyperparathyroidism or malignancy. A mnemonic to aid recall of the common causes is PAM P. SCHMIDT: parathyroid hormone, Addison disease, multiple myeloma, Paget disease, sarcoidosis, cancer, hyperthyroidism, milk-alkali syndrome, immobilization, excess vitamin D, and thiazides.  

Emergency Department Care and Disposition  
1. Initiate treatment in patients with severe symptoms, [Ca2+] above 14 milligrams/dL, or significant dehydration. Restore fluid deficits, enhance calcium elimination, and decrease osteoclastic activity.  
2. Correct fluid deficits with NS; several liters may be required. Correct concomitant electrolyte abnormalities cautiously.  
3. Loop diuretics inhibit the renal resorption of [Ca2+], but worsen dehydration and other electrolyte abnormalities. They are no longer recommended for malignancy-related hypercalcemia. In isolated cases, furosemide (10 to 40 milligrams IV) may be administered after fluid deficits are corrected, with careful attention to avoid dehydration. Thiazide diuretics should not be used.  
4. Drugs that inhibit osteoclastic activity include the bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and glucocorticoids. Recommendations for initiating therapy in the ED are lacking; consultation with a specialist is advised.  

Hypomagnesemia  
Clinical Findings  
[Mg2+], [K+], and [PO4−] move together intra- and extracellularly. Hypomagnesemia presents with CNS symptoms (depression, vertigo, ataxia, seizures, increased DTR, or tetany) or cardiac symptoms (arrhythmias, prolonged PR, QRS and QT, or worsening of digitalis effects). Also seen are anemia, hypotension, hypothermia, and dysphagia.  

Diagnosis and Differential  
In adults, the most common cause is alcoholism, followed by poor nutrition, cirrhosis, pancreatitis, correction of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), excessive gastrointestinal losses, and renal wasting (especially diuretic use). Severe [Mg2+] depletion can occur before significant laboratory changes are seen.  

Emergency Department Care and Disposition  
1. Correct volume deficits and other electrolyte abnormalities. Oral [Mg2+] replacement is sufficient for most patients.  
2. In patients with severe symptoms and normal renal function, administer 2 grams magnesium sulfate IV over an hour, followed by 6 grams over the first 24 hours. Continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent DTR checks are recommended.  

Hypermagnesemia  
Clinical Findings  
Signs and symptoms manifest progressively: nausea and somnolence occur first, followed by muscle weakness and loss of DTRs. Respiratory depression, hypotension, heart block, and cardiac arrest occur at progressively higher magnesium levels.  

Diagnosis and Differential  
Hypermagnesemia is rare. Common causes are renal failure with concomitant ingestion of [Mg2+]-containing preparations (antacids) and lithium ingestion. Serum levels are diagnostic. Hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia often present concurrently.  

Emergency Department Care and Disposition  
1. In many patients, stopping [Mg2+] intake is sufficient. More aggressive therapy includes rehydration with NS.  
2. In severely symptomatic patients, give 5 mL (10% solution) of calcium chloride IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium.  

ACID-BASE PROBLEMS  
Initial Assessment  
Clinical Features  
Several conditions should alert the clinician to possible acid-base disorders: history of renal, endocrine, or psychiatric disorders (drug ingestion); or signs of acute disease: tachypnea, cyanosis, Kussmaul respiration, respiratory failure, shock, changes in mental status, vomiting, diarrhea, or other acute fluid losses.  
Acidosis is due to gain of acid or loss of alkali; causes may be metabolic (fall in serum [HCO3−]) or respiratory (rise in PCO2). Alkalosis is due to loss of acid or addition of base and is metabolic (rise in serum [HCO3−]) or respiratory (fall in PCO2). The lungs and kidneys primarily maintain the acid–base regulation. Metabolic disorders prompt an immediate compensatory change in ventilation, thereby venting CO2 in cases of metabolic acidosis or retaining it in cases of metabolic alkalosis. The effect of the kidneys in response to metabolic disorders is to excrete the hydrogen ion (with chloride) and recuperate [HCO3−], a process that requires hours to days. The compensatory mechanisms of the lungs and kidneys will return the pH toward, but not to, normal.  

Diagnosis and Differential  
Diagnosis and differential must begin with defining the nature of the acid-base disorder and then determining the most likely etiology from the differential listings in each section.

In a mixed disorder, the pH, PCO2, and [HCO3−] may be normal, and the only clue to a metabolic acidosis is a widened anion gap (AG). 

Stepwise Method of Acid-Base Clinical Problem Solving:
- Use the patient’s pre-illness values as a baseline if available; otherwise, a pH of 7.4, [HCO3] of 24 mEq/L, and PCO2 of 40 mm Hg can be considered normal.
1. Examine the pH for acidemia (pH < 7.4) or alkalemia (pH > 7.4).
2. Establish the primary mechanism by evaluating the [HCO3−] and PCO2:
   - Metabolic acidosis: pH < 7.4 and [HCO3−] < 24 mEq/L
   - Metabolic alkalosis: pH > 7.4 and [HCO3−] > 24 mEq/L
   - Respiratory acidosis: pH < 7.4 and PCO2 > 40 mm Hg
   - Respiratory alkalosis: pH > 7.4 and PCO2 < 40 mm Hg
3. Calculate the AG: [Na+] − ([Cl−] + [HCO3−]) = approximately 10 to 12 mEq/L is normal.
   - If the AG is increased compared with the known previous value or greater than 15, then an anion gap metabolic acidosis is present.
   - If the AG is unchanged and a metabolic acidosis is present (low [HCO3−]), then a normal anion gap (or hyperchloremic) acidosis is present.
4. For anion gap metabolic acidosis, evaluate for a concomitant hidden metabolic process: each 1 mEq/L decrease in [HCO3−] results in a 1 mEq/L increase in AG. Compare the Δ Gap ( = present gap − 12) to the Δ [HCO3−] (= 24 − present [HCO3−]):
   - Δ Gap = Δ [HCO3−]: pure anion gap metabolic acidosis
   - Δ Gap > Δ [HCO3−]: concomitant metabolic alkalosis is likely present
   - Δ Gap < Δ [HCO3−]: concomitant non-AG acidosis is likely present
5. Estimate the compensatory response for the primary process. If the compensatory response is not as expected, then the compensatory mechanism requires more time for complete mobilization or a secondary acid-base disturbance exists:
   - Metabolic acidosis: expected PCO2 = (1.5 × [HCO3−] + 8) ± 2. A simpler observation is the PCO2 decreases by 1 mm Hg for every 1 mEq/dL decrease in [HCO3−]. This process takes 12 to 24 hrs.
   - Metabolic alkalosis: expected PCO2 = 0.9 [HCO3−] + 16.
   - For either of the above formulas, if:
     - Current PCO2 = expected PCO2: normal respiratory compensation
     - Current PCO2 < expected PCO2: possible concomitant respiratory alkalosis
     - Current PCO2 > expected PCO2: possible concomitant respiratory acidosis
   - Respiratory acidosis: clinically judge whether the process is acute (< 72 hrs) or chronic (> 72 hrs). The [HCO3−] increases 1 mEq/L (acute) or 4 mEq/L (chronic) for every 10 mm Hg increase in PCO2.
   - Respiratory alkalosis: clinically judge whether the process is acute (< 72 hrs) or chronic (> 72 hrs). The [HCO3−] decreases 2 mEq/L (acute) or 5 mEq/L (chronic) for every 10 mm Hg decrease in PCO2.
   - For either of the above formulas, if:
     - Current [HCO3−] = expected [HCO3−]: normal metabolic compensation.
     - Current [HCO3−] < expected [HCO3−]: possible concomitant metabolic acidosis.
     - Current [HCO3−] > expected [HCO3−]: possible concomitant metabolic alkalosis.
6. See the sections below for determining the etiology and management.

Metabolic Acidosis:
- Metabolic acidosis should be divided into an increased and normal AG acidosis. The term anion gap is misleading because the serum has no gap between total positive and negative ions; however, the unmeasured anions exceed the unmeasured cations.

Clinical Features:
- Acidosis can cause nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, change in sensorium, and tachypnea, sometimes a Kussmaul respiratory pattern. Acidosis causes many negative physiologic effects that result in hypoxia. Patients may present with nonspecific complaints or shock.

Diagnosis and Differential:
- Causes of metabolic acidosis can be divided into two main groups: (a) those associated with increased production of organic acids; and (b) those associated with a loss of [HCO3−], failure to excrete [H+], or addition of [H+].
- Causes of anion gap metabolic acidosis include renal failure, lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, and toxins. A mnemonic to aid the recall of the causes of increased AG metabolic acidosis is: A MUD PILES: alcohol, methanol, uremia, DKA, paraldehyde, iron and isoniazid, lactic acidosis, ethylene glycol, salicylates, and starvation. 

Causes of High Anion-Gap Metabolic Acidosis:
- Lactic acidosis (Type A: Decrease in tissue oxygenation; Type B: Normal tissue oxygenation)
- Renal failure (acute or chronic)
- Ketoacidosis (Diabetes, Alcoholism, Prolonged starvation, High-fat diet)
- Ingestion of toxic substances (Methanol, Ethylene glycol, Salicylate, Paraldehyde, Cyanide)

Applying the A MUD PILES mnemonic because the presence of alcohol in the patient’s blood does not rule out a more serious cause of acidosis. Iron and isoniazid exert their effects on the AG due to lactic acidosis. Causes of normal anion gap acidosis include GI or renal loss of [HCO3−]. A mnemonic that can aid the recall of normal AG metabolic acidosis is USED CARP: ureterostomy, small bowel fistulas, extra chloride, diarrhea, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, adrenal insufficiency, renal tubular acidosis, and pancreatic fistula.

Emergency Department Care and Disposition:
1. Address the underlying cause to restore tissue perfusion and oxygenation.
2. Administer fluids, oxygen, and ventilation as needed.
3. For specific etiologies, consult the appropriate chapters in this handbook for further guidance.

Indications for bicarbonate therapy are listed in Table 4-7. Give 0.5 mEq/kilogram bicarbonate for each mEq/L desired rise in [HCO3−]. The goal is to restore adequate buffer capacity ([HCO3−] > 8 mEq/dL) or achieve clinical improvement in shock or dysrhythmias. Seventy-five mEq of sodium bicarbonate in 500 mL D5W produces a nearly isotonic solution for infusion.

Indications for Bicarbonate Therapy in Metabolic Acidosis:
- Severe hypobicarbonatemia (< 4 mEq/L): Insufficient buffer concentrations may lead to extreme increases in acidemia with small increases in acidosis.
- Severe acidemia (pH < 7.20) with signs of shock or myocardial irritability that is not rapidly responsive to support measures: Therapy for the underlying cause of acidosis depends on adequate organ perfusion.
- Severe hyperchloremic acidemia: Lost bicarbonate must be regenerated by kidneys and liver, which may require days. No specific definition by pH exists. The presence of serious hemodynamic insufficiency despite supportive care should guide the use of bicarbonate therapy for this indication.

Causes of Normal Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis:
With a Tendency to Hyperkalemia:
- Subsiding DKA
- Early uremic acidosis
- Early obstructive uropathy
- Renal tubular acidosis—type IV
- Hypoaldosteronism (Addison disease)
- Infusion or ingestion of HCl, NH4Cl, lysine-HCl, or arginine-HCl
- Potassium-sparing diuretics

With a Tendency to Hypokalemia:
- Renal tubular acidosis—type I (classical distal acidosis)
- Renal tubular acidosis—type II (proximal acidosis)
- Acetazolamide
- Acute diarrhea with losses of HCO3− and K+
- Ureterosigmoidostomy with increased resorption of H+ and Cl− and losses of HCO3− and K+
- Obstruction of artificial ileal bladder
- Dilution acidosis

Metabolic alkalosis is classified as [Cl−] sensitive or [Cl−] insensitive. The two most common causes of metabolic alkalosis are excessive diuresis (with loss of potassium, hydrogen ion, and chloride) and excessive loss of gastric secretions (with loss of hydrogen ion and chloride).

Clinical Features of Metabolic Alkalosis:
Symptoms of the underlying disorder (usually fluid loss) dominate the clinical presentation, but general symptoms of metabolic alkalosis include muscular irritability, tachydysrhythmia, and impaired oxygen delivery. In most cases, there is also an associated hypokalemia and hypochloremia. Patients with [Cl−] sensitive causes present with hypovolemia secondary to vomiting, diarrhea, or diuretic therapy. Patients with [Cl−] insensitive causes present with normo- to hypervolemia associated with excess mineralocorticoid activity (renin-secreting tumors, adrenal hyperplasia, hyperaldosteronism, Cushing syndrome).

Emergency Department Care and Disposition for Metabolic Alkalosis:
1. Administer NS to treat dehydration.
2. Monitor electrolytes.

Clinical Features of Respiratory Acidosis:
Respiratory acidosis secondary to hypoventilation may be life-threatening. The clinical picture usually is dominated by the underlying disorder. Typically, respiratory acidosis depresses the mental function, which may progressively slow the respiratory rate. Patients may be confused, somnolent, and, eventually, unconscious. Pulse oximetry may be misleading, making arterial blood gases essential for the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes drug overdose, CNS disease, chest wall disease, pleural or lung disease, and trauma.

Emergency Department Care and Disposition for Respiratory Acidosis:
1. The treatment is to improve ventilation. Depressed mental status is an indication for intubation. An exception to this is opiate intoxication where rapid administration of naloxone may improve ventilation.
2. Treat the underlying disorder.

Clinical Features of Respiratory Alkalosis:
Hyperventilation syndrome is a problematic diagnosis for the emergency physician because many life-threatening disorders present with tachypnea and anxiety: asthma, pulmonary embolism, and others.

nary embolism, diabetic ketoacidosis, and others. Symptoms of respiratory alkalosis often are dominated by the primary disorder promoting the hyperventilation. Symptoms of hyperventilation include dizziness, carpal-pedal spasm, and, frequently, a chest pain described as tightness. 

The diagnosis of hyperventilation due to anxiety is a diagnosis of exclusion. Arterial blood gases can be used to rule out acidosis and hypoxia. Causes of respiratory alkalosis include CNS tumor or stroke, infection or fever, hypoxia, lung disease, hyperthyroidism, toxins (eg, sympathomimetics or aspirin), liver disease, pregnancy, and anemia.  

Emergency Department Care and Disposition  
1. Treat the underlying cause.  
2. Rule out life-threatening causes of hyperventilation before diagnosing anxiety. Anxiolytics may be helpful, such as lorazepam 1 to 2 milligrams IV or PO.  
3. Rebreathing into a paper bag can cause hypoxia; it is not recommended.          

Shock is circulatory insufficiency that creates an imbalance between tissue oxygen supply (delivery) and oxygen demand (consumption). Such tissue hypoperfusion is associated with decreased venous oxygen content and metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis). Shock is classified into four categories based on etiology: (a) hypovolemic, (b) cardiogenic, (c) distributive (eg, neurogenic and anaphylactic), and (d) obstructive.  

Factors that influence the clinical presentation of a patient in shock include the etiology, duration, and severity of the shock state and the underlying medical status of the patient. Often the precipitating cause of shock may be readily apparent (eg, acute myocardial infarction, trauma, gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding, or anaphylaxis). It is not uncommon for the patient to present with nonspecific symptoms (eg, generalized weakness, lethargy, or altered mental status). A targeted history of the presenting symptoms and previously existing conditions (eg, cardiovascular disease, GI bleeding, adrenal insufficiency, or diabetes) will aid in identifying the cause and guide the initial treatment of shock. Drug use (prescribed and nonprescribed) is an essential element of the initial history. Medication use may be the cause or a contributing factor to the evolution of shock. For example, diuretics can lead to volume depletion and cardiovascular medications (eg, β-blockers) can depress the pumping action of the heart. The possibility of drug toxicity and anaphylactic reactions to medications also should be considered. 

Assessment of vital signs is a routine part of the physical examination; however, no single vital sign or value is diagnostic in the evaluation of the presence or absence of shock. The patient’s temperature may be elevated or subnormal. The presence of hyperthermia or hypothermia may be a result of endogenous factors (eg, infections or hypometabolic states) or exogenous causes (eg, environmental exposures). The heart rate is typically elevated; however, bradycardia may be present with many conditions, such as excellent baseline physiologic status (young athletes), intraabdominal hemorrhage (secondary to vagal stimulation), cardiovascular medication use (eg, β-blockers and digoxin), hypoglycemia, and preexisting cardiovascular disease. 

The respiratory rate is frequently elevated early in shock. Increased minute ventilation, increased dead space, bronchospasm, and hypocapnia may be seen. As shock progresses, hypoventilation, respiratory failure, and respiratory distress syndrome may occur. 

Shock is usually, but not always, associated with systemic arterial hypotension, with a systolic blood pressure (BP) below 90 mm Hg. The insensitivity of blood pressure to detect global tissue hypoperfusion has been repeatedly confirmed. Thus, shock may occur with a normal blood pressure, and hypotension may occur without shock. Early in shock, the systolic and diastolic BPs may initially be normal or elevated in response to a compensatory mechanism such as tachycardia and vasoconstriction. As the body’s compensatory mechanisms fail, BP typically falls. Postural changes in BP, commonly seen with hypovolemic states, will precede overt hypotension. The pulse pressure, the difference between systolic and diastolic BP measurements, may be a more sensitive indicator. The pulse pressure usually rises early in shock and then decreases before a change in the systolic BP.

In addition to vital sign abnormalities, cardiovascular manifestations may include neck vein distention or flattening and cardiac dysrhythmias. A third heart sound (S3) may be auscultated in high-output states. Decreased coronary perfusion pressures can lead to myocardial ischemia, decreased ventricular compliance, increased left ventricular diastolic pressures, and pulmonary edema. Decreased cerebral perfusion leads to mental status changes such as weakness, restlessness, confusion, disorientation, delirium, syncope, and coma. Patients with longstanding hypertension may exhibit these changes without severe hypotension. Cutaneous manifestations may include pallor, pale or dusky skin, sweating, bruising, petechiae, cyanosis (may not be evident if the hemoglobin level is less than 5 grams/dL), altered temperature, and delayed capillary refill. 

GI manifestations resulting from low flow states may include ileus, GI bleeding, pancreatitis, acalculous cholecystitis, and mesenteric ischemia. To conserve water and sodium, levels of aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone are increased, resulting in a reduced glomerular filtration rate, redistribution of blood flow from the renal cortex to the renal medulla, and oliguria. In sepsis, a paradoxical polyuria may occur and be mistaken for adequate hydration. Early in shock, a common metabolic abnormality is respiratory alkalosis. As the shock state continues and compensatory mechanisms begin to fail, anaerobic metabolism occurs, leading to the formation of lactic acid and resulting in metabolic acidosis. Other metabolic abnormalities that may be seen are hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and hyperkalemia.

The clinical presentation and presumed etiology of shock will dictate the diagnostic studies, monitoring modalities, and interventions used. Frequently performed laboratory studies include complete blood count; platelet count; electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine determinations; prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times; and urinalysis. Other tests commonly used are arterial blood gas, lactic acid, fibrinogen, fibrin split products, D-dimer, and cortisol determinations; hepatic function panel; cerebrospinal fluid studies; and cultures of potential sources of infection. A pregnancy test should be performed on all females of childbearing potential. No single laboratory value is sensitive or specific for shock. Other common diagnostic tests include radiographs (chest and abdominal), electrocardiographs, computed tomography scans (chest, head, abdomen, and pelvis), and echocardiograms. Bedside ultrasound may also help determine the etiology of shock.

Continuous monitoring of vital signs should be instituted in all patients. Additionally, modalities such as pulse oximetry, end-tidal CO2, central venous pressure, central venous O2 saturation, cardiac output, and calculation of systemic vascular resistance and systemic oxygen delivery may be indicated. A search to determine the etiology of the shock must be undertaken. Lack of response to appropriate stabilization measures should prompt the clinician to evaluate the patient for a more occult cause. The physician must ensure that the basic steps of resuscitation have been carried out appropriately, including adequate volume resuscitation. Early use of vasopressors may elevate the central venous pressure and mask the presence of continued hypovolemia. Ensure that all equipment is connected and functioning appropriately. Carefully expose and examine the patient for occult wounds. Consider less commonly seen diagnoses, such as cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, adrenal insufficiency, toxic or allergic reactions, and occult bleeding (e.g., rupture ectopic pregnancy, or occult intraabdominal or pelvic bleeding) in the patient who is not responding as expected.

The goal of the interventions is to restore adequate tissue perfusion in concert with the identification and treatment of the underlying etiology. Aggressive airway control, best obtained through endotracheal intubation, is indicated. Associated interventions such as medications (e.g., sedatives can exacerbate hypotension) and positive pressure ventilation may reduce preload and cardiac output and may contribute to hemodynamic collapse.

Supplemental high-flow oxygen. If mechanical ventilation is used, neuromuscular blocking agents should be used to decrease lactic acidosis from muscle fatigue and increased oxygen consumption. Arterial oxygen saturation should be restored to > 93% and ventilation controlled to maintain a PaCO2 of 35 to 40 mm Hg.

Circulatory hemodynamic stabilization begins with IV access through large-bore peripheral venous lines. Central venous access aids in assessing volume status (preload) and monitoring ScvO2. US guidance has proven helpful with these procedures. Central venous access is the preferred route for the long-term administration of vasopressor therapy. The Trendelenburg position does not improve cardiopulmonary performance compared with the supine position, and it may worsen pulmonary gas exchange and predispose to aspiration. Passive leg raising above the level of the heart with the patient supine can be effective. Early surgical consultation is indicated for internal bleeding. Most external hemorrhage can be controlled by direct compression. Rarely will clamping or tying off of vessels be needed.

The type, amount, and rate of fluid replacement remain areas of controversy. There is no difference in survival comparing crystalloid with colloid resuscitation. Crystalloid solutions continue to be recommended because of the increased cost of colloid agents. Most use isotonic crystalloid intravenous fluids (0.9% NaCl, Ringer lactate) in the initial resuscitation phase. Due to the increased cost, lack of proven benefit, and potential for disease transmission (with FFP), the routine use of colloids (5% albumin, purified protein fraction, fresh-frozen plasma [FFP], and synthetic colloid solutions [hydroxyethyl starch or dextran 70]) is questionable. Standard therapy in the hemodynamically unstable patient is 20 to 40 mL/kilogram given rapidly (over 10 to 20 min). Because only about 30% of infused isotonic crystalloids remain in the intravascular space, it is recommended to infuse approximately 3 times the estimated blood loss in acute hemorrhagic shock. However, the benefits of early and aggressive fluid replacement in these trauma patients remain unproven as do the benefits of permissive hypotension.

Blood remains the ideal resuscitative fluid. When possible, use fully cross-matched PRBCs. If the clinical situation dictates more rapid intervention, type-specific, type O (rhesus negative to be given to females of childbearing years) may be used. The decision to use platelets or FFP should be based on clinical evidence of impaired hemostasis and frequent monitoring of coagulation parameters. Platelets are generally given if there is ongoing hemorrhage and the platelet count is 50,000/mm3 or lower; administer 6 units initially. FFP is indicated if the prothrombin time is prolonged beyond 1.5 seconds; administer 2 units initially. Trauma patients requiring transfusion of multiple units of packed RBCs should receive FFP and platelets early in ratios that approach 1:1:1 in order to address the accompanying coagulopathy that will likely be present. The use of fresh whole blood has also been advocated and may be the most effective approach for such patients. The potential need for FFP and platelet transfusions should be considered early and reassessed frequently in an effort to detect and limit the adverse effects of trauma-induced coagulopathy.

Vasopressors are used after appropriate volume resuscitation has occurred and there is persistent hypotension. Possible choices include: dobutamine 2.0 to 20.0 micrograms/kilogram/min, dopamine 5.0 to 20.0 micrograms/kilogram/min, and norepinephrine 0.5 to 30.0 micrograms/min.

The goal of resuscitation is to maximize survival and minimize morbidity using objective hemodynamic and physiologic values to guide therapy. A goal-directed approach of urine output > 0.5 mL/kilogram/h, CVP 8 to 12 mm Hg, MAP 65 to 90 mm Hg, and ScvO2 > 70% during ED resuscitation of septic shock significantly decreases mortality.

Acidosis should be treated with adequate ventilation and fluid resuscitation. Sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kilogram) use is controversial. Use only in the setting of severe acidosis refractory to above-mentioned methods. Correct only to arterial pH 7.25.

Early surgical or medical consultation for admission or transfer is indicated.

localized urticaria to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis refers to the most severe form of immediate hypersensitivity reaction and encompasses both IgE-mediated reactions and anaphylactoid reactions, which do not require a previous sensitizing exposure. 

Anaphylaxis may occur within seconds or be delayed over an hour after an exposure; more rapid reactions are associated with higher mortality. Common exposures are foods, medications, insect stings, and allergen immunotherapy injections. Many cases are idiopathic. Criteria for anaphylaxis describe an acute progression of organ system involvement that may lead to cardiovascular collapse. Organ system involvement can include dermatologic (pruritus, flushing, urticaria, erythema multiforme, angioedema), respiratory tract (dyspnea, wheezing, cough, stridor, rhinorrhea), cardiovascular (dysrhythmias, collapse, arrest), gastrointestinal (cramping, vomiting, diarrhea), genitourinary (urgency, cramping), and eye (pruritus, tearing, redness). A biphasic mediator release can occur in up to 20% of cases causing recurrence of symptoms 4 to 8 hours after the initial exposure. Patients on β-blockers are susceptible to an exaggerated allergic response and may be refractory to first line treatment.  

Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis. History may confirm exposure to a possible allergen, such as a new drug, food, or sting. There is no specific test to verify the diagnosis in real time; anaphylaxis should be considered in any rapidly progressing multi-system illness. Workup should be directed at ruling out other diagnoses while stabilizing the patient. The differential depends on the organ systems involved and may include myocardial ischemia, gastroenteritis, asthma, carcinoid, epiglottitis, hereditary angioedema, and vasovagal reactions.  

Resuscitation must begin with airway, breathing, and circulation. Patients with confirmed or suspected anaphylaxis should be placed on a cardiac monitor with pulse oximetry, and intravenous access should be obtained. 
1. Administer oxygen as indicated by oximetry. Angioedema or respiratory distress should prompt early consideration for intubation. Preparations should be made for “rescue” transtracheal jet insufflation or cricothyroidotomy.  
2. Limit further exposure. This may be as simple as stopping an intravenous drug or removing a stinger. First aid measures, ice, and elevation may be helpful for local symptoms.  
3. First line therapy for anaphylaxis is epinephrine. In patients without cardiovascular collapse, administer 0.3 to 0.5 milligram (0.3 to 0.5 mL of 1:1000; pediatric dose, 0.01 milligram/kilogram to a maximum of 0.5 milligram) intramuscularly in the thigh. The dose may be repeated every 5 min as needed. Patients who are refractory to IM dosing or in significant shock should receive intravenous epinephrine. A bolus of 100 micrograms of 1:100 000 dilution (place 0.1 mL of 1:1000 in 10 mL normal saline) can be given over 5 to 10 min followed by an infusion of 1 to 4 micrograms/min, with close observation for chest pain or arrhythmias.  
4. Hypotensive patients require aggressive fluid resuscitation with normal saline 1 to 2 L (pediatric dose, 10 to 20 mL/kilogram).  
5. Steroids should be used in all cases of anaphylaxis to control persistent or delayed reactions. Severe cases can be treated with methylprednisolone 125 milligrams IV (pediatric dose, 2 milligrams/kilogram). Mild allergic reactions can be treated with oral prednisone 60 milligrams (pediatric dose, 2 milligrams/kilogram).  
6. Every patient with severe allergic symptoms requires antihistamines. Diphenhydramine can be given 50 milligrams IV (pediatric dose, 1 milligram/kilogram). In addition, an H2 blocker such as ranitidine 50 milligrams IV (pediatric dose, 0.5 milligram/kilogram) may be helpful.  
7. Bronchospasm can be treated with nebulized β-agonists such as albuterol 2.5 milligrams. If refractory, consider an inhaled anticholinergic, ipratropium bromide 250 micrograms, and intravenous magnesium 2 grams (25 to 50 milligrams/kilogram in children) over 20 to 30 min.  
8. For patients on β-blockers with hypotension refractory to epinephrine and fluids, use glucagon 1 milligram IV every 5 min. An infusion of 5 to 15 micrograms/min should be started once blood pressure improves.  
9. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are a common trigger for nonallergic angioedema. Airway compromise can develop rapidly. Treatment is supportive. Epinephrine, steroids, and antihistamines are often given although benefit has not been proven.  
10. Patients with hereditary angioedema do not respond to treatment for anaphylaxis and should be treated accordingly.

C1 esterase inhibitor replacement is the primary treatment for patients with unstable or refractory symptoms. Fresh frozen plasma can be an alternative when C1 esterase inhibitor replacement is unavailable. Unstable or refractory patients should be admitted to the intensive care unit, while those with moderate to severe symptoms should be admitted for observation. Patients with mild allergic reactions can be observed in the emergency department (ED) and may be sent home if symptoms are stable or improving. Stable patients who received epinephrine are generally considered safe for discharge after 4 hours without symptoms. It is advisable to observe patients with a history of severe reactions and those on β-blockers for a longer period.

Discharge instructions should include an antihistamine and a short course of prednisone. Patients should be counseled on the importance of returning to the ED for late recurrence of symptoms and avoiding known allergens. All patients who have experienced severe allergic reactions should have and know how to use an epinephrine autoinjector. Consider recommending Medic-Alert bracelets and referral to an allergist for these patients.

Acute pain is present in 50% to 60% of all ED patients, and procedural sedation and analgesia are often needed for painful interventions or diagnostic studies. Responses to pain can include increased heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and behavioral changes. Pain is assessed with objective scales, and pain relief requires dynamic reassessment.

Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions can help manage anxiety and pain in the ED. Nonpharmacologic interventions include heat or cold application, immobilization and elevation of injured extremities, explanation and reassurance, music, biofeedback, guided imagery, and distraction methods. Discussing a painful intervention with a patient before the procedure may reduce anxiety.

For acute pain control, nonopiate analgesics such as acetaminophen (650 to 1000 milligrams or 15 milligrams/kilogram PO or PR in children) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (400 to 800 milligrams PO or 10 milligrams/kilogram PO in children) can be used for mild to moderate pain. Parenteral NSAIDs are no more effective than oral medications, and adverse effects include gastrointestinal irritation, renal dysfunction, platelet dysfunction, and impaired coagulation. Aspirin should be avoided in children due to its association with Reye syndrome.

Opiates such as morphine (0.1 milligram/kilogram IV or 0.1 to 0.3 milligram/kilogram in children) and fentanyl (1.5 micrograms/kilogram IV) are also options for pain management.
